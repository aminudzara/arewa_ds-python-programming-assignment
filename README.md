# Arewa Data Science Academy Python Programming Fellowship

Welcome to my practice repository for Python exercises from the Arewa Data Science Academy Python Programming Fellowship.

Each folder in this repository is organized by topic and contains exercises relevant to its name. For example, the folder `02_module_variables_functions` contains exercises related to working with variables and builtin functions.

Feel free to explore and learn with me as I work through these exercises!
